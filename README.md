# Hey! Thanks for dropping by. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer. I most recently was building internal tools and the My Retail Rebel at [RevLogical](https://www.revlogical.com/) where I worked with TypeScript, NextJS, MySQL, Postgres, Firebase, Expo, and bunch of other technologies to modernize logistics with inventory tools and mobile applications. Now, I'm focusing on contributing to open source. I'm also participating in a fellowship with [Formation](https://www.formation.dev) where I work closely with other talented engineers from companies like Netflix, Google, and Meta to improve my engineering skills.
