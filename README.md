# Hey! Thanks for dropping by. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer. I'm currently building internal tools and the My Retail Rebel at [RevLogical](https://www.revlogical.com/) where I work with TypeScript, NextJS, MySQL, Postgres, Firebase, Expo, and bunch of other technologies to modernize logistics with inventory tools and mobile applications. I'm also participating in a fellowship with [Formation](https://www.formation.dev) where I work closely with talented engineers from companies like Netflix, Google, and Meta to improve my engineering skills.

Trying to find the time to contribute to open source projects and build my own side projects.


Here are some ideas I've been tinkering with but haven't had time to execute yet.

- Command Pallete Web Extension
- SaaS for finding great off-market opportunities buying small businesses
- SaaS for 24/7 live agent lead qualification and engagement
- Online marketplace for buying, selling, and trading collectible cards.
