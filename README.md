# Hey! Thanks for dropping by. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer. I'm currently working internal tools at [Revlogical](https://www.revlogical.com/) where we're leveraging TypeScript, NextJs, MySql, Postgres, Firebase, Expo, and bunch of other technologies to modernize logistics. I'm also participating in a fellowship with [Formation](https://www.formation.dev) where I work closely with talented engineers from companies like Netflix, Google, and Meta to improve my engineering skills.
