# Hey! Thanks for dropping by. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software engineer. I most recently was building internal tools and the My Retail Rebel app at [RevLogical](https://www.revlogical.com/) where I worked with TypeScript, NextJS, MySQL, Postgres, Firebase, Expo, and bunch of other technologies to modernize logistics with inventory tools and mobile applications. I'm also participating in a fellowship with [Formation](https://www.formation.dev) where I work closely with other talented engineers from companies like Netflix, Google, and Meta to improve my engineering skills.
